# Exam-Statistics
This repository contains a python code that I wrote when I served as a Computer Science Teaching Assistant for the course "Computing in Science and Engineering". The code automates the data aggregation, cleaning, analysis and presentation of performance trends and exam statistics to help the instructor and TAs assess how well students achieved the learning outcomes.
