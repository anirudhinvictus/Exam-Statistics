# Exam-Statistics
This repository contains a python code that I wrote when I served as a Computer Science Teaching Assistant for the course "Computing in Science and Engineering". The code automates the data aggregation, cleaning, analysis and presentation of performance trends and exam statistics to help the instructor and TAs assess how well students achieved the learning outcomes. In specific, this code helps gain a better understanding of individual questions and their correlation with the student's overall exam performance. Difficulty plots and Correlation plots are used to visualize this analysis
